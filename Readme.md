# Bad Apple in Fontawesome

The aim of this project is to recreate the famous bad apple music video using icons from the fontawesome library.
Icons for black and white pixels as well as the output resolution can be set via the config file included.

Ill be dabbeling with the pillow image library for python and trying to render a preview frontend using tkinter
Fontawesome icons will be integrated using the ttkbootstrap-icons-fa package.

Lets see where this journey takes me..

First hurdle:
Installing ffmpeg to path in windows. Why am i still not using the wsl?
